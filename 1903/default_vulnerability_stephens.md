  Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Default Credential Vulnerability

  Talking points for your presentation:

- Intro: name, mod4BE
- why important to me? I studied cybersecurity.  This topic is a way of tying that into
Turing.  It also shows how we, as devs, have to consider things beyond just how the code works (such
  as potential nefarious uses of our code).  Basically raising awareness of our responsibilities.
1. what is it?  Hackers using default passwords that were never changed to gain access to a system.
2. where it’s used? Almost everywhere – routers, modems, IoT devices.
3. ease of use? There are sites like www.defaultpassword.com that allow for easy access.
4. harm? Anything from annoyance to catastrophic
5. examples.  Listening in to an elevator emergency phone, gaining access to neighbor’s wifi
6. why are there defaults? Ease of setup.  Used if device is sold and the new owner wants to gain access to reconfigure the device.  Ease of troubleshooting.


  2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. Do we, as devs, have a responsibility to not use default passwords?  Or is this something that should be left up to the end user (ie. our responsibility ends once the product is shipped out the door)?
    2. How could we, as devs, get around every device being manufactured with the same credentials?
    3. What would be the impacts – both to us as devs, and to the consumer - of every device having separate credentials?
    4. Are any parts of society in particular impacted by this?
