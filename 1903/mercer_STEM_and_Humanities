  Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Don't Forget Your Humanity
  
  Connection: Both of my parents are in STEM fields, one in finance and one in chemistry. However, they emphasized the importance of humanitarian ideals while I was growing up, especially the ideal of compassion. Both of my parents are very successful in their own rights, and I believe it is due in part to their drive to employ humanitarian ideals within their STEM work that has fostered that success.
  
  Talking points for your presentation:
    - Introduction
      - Thesis
        - "The integration of the Humanities into STEM fields is crucial as we continue expanding our global society."
      - Monolithic entities with global impact can have a homogenizing effect if production is centrally located.
      - Those entities can find greater success and influence in those cultures by employing humanitarian ideals.
    - Definitions
      - What is STEM?
      - What is Humanitarian Study?
        - Where do they come from: Brief History of Non-STEM Study & its impact (this would include references to Greek philosophy and the enlightenment, but also to modern civil rights movements and their origins)
    - The Expanding Self: Learning about society and the self takes more than day to day experience, it takes exposure to new ideas. Otherwise every social transaction reiterates Mother Cultural values.
    - Tech is not an end in and of itself -- Humanities offers insight into the ends. (This is what got us into this Facebook mess with privacy and Transgender names.)
      - We know the humanities help:
            - broaden our global views
            - broaden our intellectual foundations
            - teach clear and effective communication
            - teach creative and critical thinking skills
            - teach us abstract reasoning and problem solving
            - foster engaged thinkers and citizens
            - help us to understand the impact that science, technology, and medicine have had on society
  
  2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. How will you seek out exposure to Humanities topics in your day to day life, knowing their importance?
    2. How has your concept of the humanities shaped the sorts of tech you've already worked on?
    3. In what ways could a Humanities-centric perspective be deployed within a technological business? (Think 'missions')
