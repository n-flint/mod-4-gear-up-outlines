### Name of your Gear Up Presentation: 

* Let's End The Stigma of Mental Illness

### Introduction of yourself: 

* Logan Pile (He/Him)

### Why did you select this topic? Why is it of interest?

* I want to bring awareness to mental health because everyone experiences it but the topic is not widely discuss in society.

### Detailed description of the science of the topic: 

* Mental illnesses may be caused by a reaction to environmental stresses, genetic factors, biochemical imbalances, or a combination of these.

### How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? 

* Bringing awareness to a topic that isn't widely talked about.

### How will this impact you as a developer? 

* While programming skills are important, being able to deal with mental health issues is as equally important to do the job. We need to be able to communicate mental health ideas and problems, both on a professional and personal level.

### Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:

1. Have you experienced stress or depression during your time at Turing? What helped you get through?
2. What can we do to bring more awareness to this topic?
