Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Regulating Artificial Intelligence

Talking points for your presentation:

In the future we will be dealing with artificial intelligence on a deeper scale than we can imagine at this point in our lives. We need to prepare ourselves for the rise of AI technology by setting regulations. I want to find out what others think about possible circumstances and regulations needed or are they even necessary at all?

I. Current Growth of Artificial Intelligence
- I will discuss the industry and how far we've advanced with examples

II. Future Growth of Artificial Intelligence
- Discuss the different possibilities of the future of AI
-- Near future and distant future

III. Regulations vs Freedom of AI
- Pros and cons of regulation and over-regulation
- Can AI have desires and motives? (with clarification)
- Restrictions for AI taking human jobs? (with solutions)

2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation: 
1. How would you go about regulating AI or why wouldn't you?  
2. Would you vote for an AI in a political election - why or why not?
3. Who gets to decide the laws and regulations for AI?
