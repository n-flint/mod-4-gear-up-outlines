[The slides are empty, but this is the style I chose](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15W29-ti0oIwfI4W0AD4ZH8mLbFmeQmQrlqcU-3mze64/edit?usp=sharing)

I was thinking of titling the talk, "The Ghost and the Goblin" which is a reference to the study I focus on and will be made clear before the end of the talk. I wouldn't mind changing the title to something more descriptive/less creepy. I also thought I'd have time to edit my outline before I submitted, so it's kind of unintelligable/unfinished.

*outline*
- intro
	- many years ago i read a study involving children’s conception of the “life” and “death” of their furbies, past and present
	- the earnest attempts to understand and disturbing interpretations of the biology of a furby has stuck with me and i reflect on it more as we talk more about the ways our biases and assumptions inform the technology we help develop
	- i want to talk about the ways our ideas about psyche and ourselves has developed since the first introductions of tech to our personal lives forty years ago. the bulk of my information comes from “Alone Together” by sherry turk
- BRIEF overview of how the introduction of psychoanalysis (freud, jung) changed the way people thought and spoke esp of the “self”
  - this is a process humanity has gone through many times when new concepts are introduced
- similar examples of the way language evolved post integration of technology into personal lives 
	- when working with the computer, “there’s a little piece of your mind and now it’s a little piece of the computer’s mind.”
	- "Computers no longer wait for humans to project meaning onto them. Now, sociable robots meet our gaze, speak to us, and learn to recognize us. They ask us to take care of them; in response, we imagine that they might care for us in return."
	- thinking about robots is a way of thinking about the essence of personhood.
- furby
	- kids are mirrors
	- idea of mechanical as biological, biological as mechanical
  - the ghost and the goblin
	- more than projection, we develop relationships that feel very real to us
