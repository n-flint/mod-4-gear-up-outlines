  Name of your Gear Up Presentation: The Merits and Pitfalls of Open Source
  
  Talking points for your presentation:
  - As new developers about to enter the workforce, we hear the refrain of 'contribute to open source!' all the time. But is that really in our best interests? Doesn't that just mean we're doing work that we're not getting paid for? The conversation of 'free as in speech, not as in beer' has been surrounding open source since its inception, and it's an important one to have. You should know what you can do, why you should do it, and how much is expected from you. This also ties into your rights, as you should not be taken advantage of in these situations.  
  - Introduction to the definition of Open Source
  - Talk about how OpenSource has progressed and provided amazing things to the world
  - Intro to the darker side of things
  - Focus on Corporations taking advantage of free software
  - Focus on demographics of Open Source contributors, majority being white men
  - Focus on the ironic failure of Linus' Law (more eyes means less bugs)
  - Focus on psychological effects of devs spending so much time beyond their day jobs on open source
  - - Lack of compensation
  - - Meritocratic requirement for OpenSource projects on applicants resumes
  - - Burnout
  - Bring it back positive about companies doing it right (

  
  2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. Has your opinion on contributing to Open Source changed after seeing this?

    3. Have you ever contributed to an Open Source project, if so, which one and why?
