  Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Workplace Ethics of the Video Game Industry
  
  Talking points for your presentation:
    Developers in the video game industry are forced to work crazy hours
    Developers are often not provided benefits in their job as they are let go so often
    Women in the certain aspects of the gaming industry are paid staggeringly less that men(art and sound especially)
    Union attempts of developers have led to some unable to find jobs at any workplace in the industry
    Game developers at large companies do not recieve any royalties for the projects they create, despite these games-sometimes selling billions

  
  2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. Is it ethical for video game players to be supporting these practices financially by buying games
    2. Is it important for us as developers in different industries to look out for an attempt to help developers in these industires
    3.Do better working conditions in one field of software make for better working conditions in all areas of software development or is it better to focus on our own fields first?
