Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Software as Private Property

Introduction of yourself: Christopher Davis, Pronouns: they/them

Why did you select this topic? Why is it of interest?

Detailed description of the science of the topic: Going to go into legal ramifications of code creation for profit, and FOSS software's history of fighting back.

How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? As we create code to solve problems, being locked out of our own work by legal systems is something worth fighting against.

How will this impact you as a developer? Our entire job will be centered around creation of unique code and work. Since this is going to be our day to day life, this topic will impact us if we think about it or not.

Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation: *Not final* "As a developer, do you feel like it's worth your time and energy to assist in the creation of open source software? Why or why not?
What would development look like if there were no IP laws or proprietary software?
How do you personally feel about giving up rights to the code you have created for a paycheck? Is this a good tradeoff for you personally in the long term?"
