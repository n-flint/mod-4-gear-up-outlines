Name of your Gear Up Presentation: __the hard choices of developers____________________

Talking points for your presentation:
if we do our job wrong there could be money loss, security threats, loss of trust, even injury or death

boeing 737 max crashes kills 360 some people

show video of racist soap dispenser

I used to work with this tech and I know the problem is lighting

3 sensor options and cost that could fix this

price of current product vs competition

price after each fix taking profit into account vs competitors

problems with each potential fix





2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation: 1. 2. 3.
1) split group into who thinks we should fix and who thinks we should leave it 
make each group come up with 3 supporting ideas for the oppsit side then discuss them as a class

the idea is to point out that there are normally more things than meets the eye that go into choices that need to be made and there is always a risk

2) Working at a company that makes a bad choice will happen, what they do about it is what matters. What will you do to determine if a company is responsible?
