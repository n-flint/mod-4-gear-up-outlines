Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Reusing Code the Right Way
  
### Talking points for your presentation:
#### What is 'Code Reuse'?
#### What is bad reuse?
* Reuse is bad in education and at Turing. It stunts students' development and actually counteract the learning process.
* At Turing and in the workforce, inappropriate code reuse is considered plagiarism and grounds for dismissal.
#### What is good reuse?
* Internal code at a company may have been written specifically to be reused later in the future.
* Third-party code is available for hire and can offer time/cost benefits to the company who needs it.
#### Why talk about it?
* Find quotes about software engineers not considering other sources available besides writing something from scratch.
* This is a fairly normal practice in the real world. 
* Use shadowing experience as an example - reusing another department's code, asking them questions, and going through line-by-line to remove anything unnecessary and tailor the code as needed. 
#### What are the pitfalls in reusing code?
* Inherited bugs
* Unfamiliar code in the programmer's product
#### How to avoid the pitfalls?
* Go line by line
* Use it as a template, not a copy/paste
      
    




  
 # 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. What are some of the disasters that might come from blindly copying code?
    2. How can you avoid these disasters on a day-by-day basis?
    3. How does reusing/copying code while at Turing stunt our development?
    
    
 # Peer Feedback:
    1. What is interesting about this talk?
    Answer: implications of using it in an educational vs work setting.
    2. What is one way it could be improved?
    Answer: look into the MIT and opensource reference (such as source code open and free) and possibly bring this up.
