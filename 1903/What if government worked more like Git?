####What if government worked more like Git?

[Slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1I6GHrg2aeTiNbuvnMP193hcDshzNYOiJrG79JNnwW74/edit#slide=id.g5f98beb8ab_0_273)

Talking points:

1) Do you think there already is or could be software that must be free and open source? 
2) (reviewed) Other than git and open-source, what things from the software development world might be useful in government or lawmaking?
3) Can you see any pitfalls or problems that might arise out of increased collaboration in lawmaking or governing?

Suggestion from peer review: as I was talking about it the impression was that the presentation would go too long. I should cut some ideas. Change my second talking point, since it's a little unclear (done).
