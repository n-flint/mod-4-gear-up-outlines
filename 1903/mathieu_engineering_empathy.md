  Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Engineering Empathy
  
  Talking points for your presentation: [Talking Points](https://gist.github.com/alexander-mathieu/16bd67684a0c8e125c3b2731efd335ec)
  
  2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. Can empathy be engineered, or is this type of AI something else entirely? If it’s empathy, does it matter if it comes from a place of compassion or capitalism?
    2. Should you be warned when you’re interacting with something that’s only seemingly human?
    3. In a world with increasingly less interaction between people, what are the repercussions of having AI that’s able to act on your behalf?
